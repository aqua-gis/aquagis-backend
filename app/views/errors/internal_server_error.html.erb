<h1>Application error</h1>
<p>The AquaGIS server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request (HTTP 500)</p>
<p>Feel free to <a href="http://wiki.aquagis.bg/wiki/Contact" title="Various contact channels explained">contact</a> the AquaGIS community if your problem persists. Make a note of the exact URL / post data of your request.</p>
<p>This may be a problem in our Ruby On Rails code. 500 occurs with exceptions thrown outside of an action (like in Dispatcher setups or broken Ruby code)</p>
